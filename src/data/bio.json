I've been organising the Newcastle Coders Group since 2013, I'm a moderator of the Newwwie Slack community, and I'm part of the organising community for the ..NEW software development conference. I'm constantly blown away by the friendliness and openness of Newcastle's tech community; everyone is welcome and valued. \nOutside of Software Development, I'm a husband of more than ten years, and a martial arts fan training with the Newcastle Karate School and Machida Brazillian JiuJitsu Club in Hamilton, Newcastle."
